        <h1>The Story of Me and My Cat</h1>
        <p>Hi, I'm Nory, and I'm a cat person. I want to share my cat's daily life with you from the first perspective of my cat Lucky!</p>
        <h2>Welcome to the World of me and my cat Lucky!</h2>

    <p> For me, my most important companion is Lucky, the cat I have had for two years. Most cat hosts don't take their cats outside, but my hobby is to take Lucky for a walk every day. When Lucky played in the park, I would listen to music or read books quietly. I really enjoyed the process and Lucky also had a lot of different experiences than other kittens. She used to roll in the grass, chase butterflies in the garden, hide in the leaves and play hide-and-seek with me, and run through the snow. I always wondered, do cats have thoughts and feelings like humans? In my spare time, I always like to use the cat's first perspective to record some interesting things happened between me and her. I want to create a website for Lucky so that more people can see the story of what happened between me and my cat. I divided the website into four sections: spring, summer, autumn and winter. Each section records a different story of Lucky. I'd like to share my life with my cat, as well as some information about cats for some cat lovers below.</p>
